Day 13: Arrival
---------------

We book a room in the `Barim Pension <http://www.barimpension.net>`_ in
Selçuk.  Half of the day is gone with travelling from `Datça
<|static|/2013-06-06-Datca.rst>`_. 5 mins from the hotel there's a very
nice sandy beach: the travel book does not devote too many words to it, but
this is the best sandy beach we encountered during our stay in Turkey.

After the walk on the seashore, we stroll a bit in the not too spectacular
city center, eat something and visit a mini-mosque.

Day 14: Ephesus
---------------

We spend most of the day walking among the ruins of Ephesus_.  This is one
of the most known archaeological sites of Turkey (the other may be Troy),
This means, of course, a lot of tourists but the place really is worth a
visit.  The amount of (still ongoing) work put in restoration is amazing: it
is a great tourist attraction, because large part of the site is very well
preserved.  Some parts of the grand theatre was actually re-built with
modern materials in the last century and now archaeologists are trying to
figure out the best way to present the remaining of its ancient, "true"
state.
