Cardboard Raspberry Pi case
===========================

I bought a `Raspberry Pi <http://raspberrypi.org>`_.  No need to explain
this since nowadays *everybody* buys a Raspberry Pi.  Even if I don't use it,
large part of its (not too high) price goes for charity, I figured.

I was reluctant to buy a casing for it in the shop, because I wanted to
build it myself.  There are tons of interesting RPi case projects out there,
but I found `Jude Pullen
<http://www.judepullen.com/designmodelling/raspberry-pi-case/>`_'s the most
interesting.  I followed his instructions and the result is a very cool
Raspberry Pi case out of cardboard.  In fact, I recycled the packaging of my
new ThinkPad.

I didn't do the light-pipes.  I'm not sure if this is the Pi's final casing
and I didn't want to glue anything onto the board itself.  In summary,
working with cardboard is easy, fun and kept me away from the computer for
some nights.  I may build a better version (with light pipes), or even
something completely different in the future.
