Swiss Snow Walk and Run 2017
============================
:tags: race, running

As a nice apetizer for the year we signed up for a snow race in Arosa.  Since I had never run a half-marathon in snow I had no reference point what time to expect.  I took the race easy, enjoyed the scenery and the frosty weather.  Despite the winter conditions (-15 Celsius), the race felt great, I had no problems with the cold.
