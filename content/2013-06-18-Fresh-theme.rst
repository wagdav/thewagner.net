Fresh theme
===========

I changed the blog's theme from the default to `fresh`_.  I wanted to have
something that uses `Twitter Bootstrap`_ so that if you resize the browser
window, or read the posts on a small screen, the layout changes dynamically.

Also, now there's a Github ribbon in the top right corner, and social links
on the right.
