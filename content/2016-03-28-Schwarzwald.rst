Freiburg
--------

We spent the 4 day long weekend (both Good Friday and Easter Monday are bank holidays in Vaud) of Easter in the Schwarzwald.  The train connection between Lausanne and Freiburg is great. Even though there's no direct train, the connections are well synchronized and the whole trip takes a little more than 3 hours. On Thursday at 9pm we were already in Freiburg.

On Friday it was raining almost the whole day and all the shops were closed.  It was not terribly bad, but an empty city with clouds and rain does not leave a great impressions.

We climbed up the tower of the cathedral and visited the city zoo.

Hinterzarten—Äula—Seebrugg
--------------------------

In the morning we prepared to leave Freiburg heading for a hike in the Schwarzwald. We took the train to Hinterzarten where we started our walk just a bit after noon. We went around by the highest point of the region (Feldberg 1493m), which we couldn't conquer due to lack of time. The whole day we covered approximately 18km.

We spent the evening in Äula in a `cosy guest house <http://www.roessle-schluchsee.de/>`_.

The day after we started the day with a 10km walk to Seebrugg train station.  Then a short train ride to Titisee, a nice resort by a lake of the same name.  In about an hour we could make a complete tour around the lake by which we concluded the hiking part of our day and of our trip as well.

After a bit of shopping in Titisee (we bought some delicious `Black Forest ham`_) we took the train to Baden-Baden.

Baden-Baden
-----------

We spent only a day here, so we only had time for the very essentials.  Sunday night we walked around in the city center, Monday morning we visited the `Museum Frieder Burda`_ and, before our train left, the `Merkur mountain`_.

The return trip was not as smooth as the way there: our train arrived with almost an hour later.  Fortunately it managed to catch up and we arrived only half an hour later to Lausanne.
