title: Leaving Pix4D
---

After four years at [Pix4D][Pix4D], today is my last working day.  This article
presents my main projects and some lessons learned at this company.

# Calibration Team

I joined Pix4D's Calibration Team in August 2017 as a C++ developer.  My first
task was to improve the quality report generated by the first stage of
[PIX4Dmapper][Mapper]'s image processing pipeline.

* *Best times:* I learned a about [photogrammetry][WikiPhotogrammetry].
* *Worst times:* I rearranged a data structure in some reporting code and the
  performance of a seemingly unrelated module dropped 10%.  The team spent
  weeks tracking down why this happened.
* *Lesson learned:* Fighting code complexity is the hardest problem in
  maintaining a successful software product.

# Integration Team

In 2018 I joined the Integration Team to work on a new build automation system
for the company.  Developers needed a tool to build and test their applications
and libraries on various platforms.  I developed an interest in building cloud
infrastructure and deployment pipelines.

* *Best times:* I learned about Amazon Web Services and about modern tools for
  deploying distributed systems.
* *Worst times:* Because of an unpinned dependency we picked up a kernel update
  with a bug that crippled our entire fleet of build machines.
* *Lesson learned:* When working on a green-field project our head is full of
  creative ideas and it's easy to [miss prior work][WikiReinventing].

The experience in this team inspired me to experiment with [my own build
automation system][PostKevlar].

# Cloud Services Team

At the end of 2019 I was invited to join Cloud Services, the team responsible
for Pix4D's photogrammetry processing service.  I was excited to work on a live
system serving paying customers.  I also had a chance to lead the technical
work of a small team.

* *Best times:* I learned about the operation and maintenance of a production
  cloud system.
* *Worst times:* Browsing through a hundred SQS queues trying to
  reverse-engineer what they're for.
* *Lesson learned:* Building things incrementally is a good idea.  Figuring out
  what _not_ to build is a better idea.

The work in this team [rekindled my interest in Nix][PostNix] and led me to
[build a decent Homelab][PostHomelab].

# Summary

After four great years at Pix4D I'm moving on.  I accepted a job at
[Nexthink](https://www.nexthink.com/) where I keep learning about the
intricacies of cloud systems.

I wish everybody at Pix4D a lot of success!
