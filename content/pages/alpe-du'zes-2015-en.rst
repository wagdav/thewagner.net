Summary
-------

I'm raising money to fund cancer research and I'm asking your help.  On 4th June, I will climb by bike the legendary Alpe du'Huez.  Six times in a row.  You can sponsor my climbs by donating money.  Every cent will go directly to the `Dutch Cancer Society <http://www.kwf.nl/english/Pages/The-organisation.aspx>`_.

The event
---------

Almost everybody will at some point in their lives be affected by cancer, from far away or close by.  For me, it has come close over the past year.  The mother of a friend of mine  will not be able to win her fight against the disease.  However, due to the hard work of researchers and doctors, incredible advances are being made towards new treatments and better quality of life for patients.  The hope is that fewer and fewer people will die from cancer and that eventually a large subset cancers will become chronic diseases.

To give some meaning to a helpless situation, we (a group of friends that most of you know well) will participate in the biggest fundraising event in `The Netherlands: Alpe d’HuZes <http://www.opgevenisgeenoptie.nl>`_ (unfortunately most of the information is only available in Dutch).  It has succeeded in raising 109 million euros for the Dutch Cancer Society over the past 9 years!  The idea is that we will try to push ourselves to our mental and physical limits by running or biking up the famous Alpe d'Huez climb up to six times, with people donating a fixed amount or something per climb.


The climb
---------

L'Alpe d'Huez is climbed regularly in the Tour de France.  It was first included in the race in 1952 and has been a stage finish regularly since 1976 (see more on `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpe_d%27Huez#Cycle_racing>`_).  On 4th June I will attempt to climb the Alpe du'Huez six times in a row.

How to donate?
--------------

I am kindly reaching out for donations to you.  Every cent will go directly to the Dutch Cancer Society.  Unfortunately the event's donation system is only available in Dutch.  Therefore, I suggest to use the *first method*:

1. (preferred) Send me a mail with a subject *Alpe du'Zes* and you'll receive my account details where you can transfer the money (PayPal, IBAN number).  I will forward your donation to the organisation and you will receive the invoice.

2. (if you speak Dutch) `Click here <http://deelnemers.opgevenisgeenoptie.nl/acties/davidwagner/david-wagner/donationdirect.aspx>`_ and follow the instructions for a bank-transfer `here <http://bit.ly/1EoLMw7>`_.


Thank you!
