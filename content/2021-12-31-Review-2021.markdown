title: Year 2021 in review
---

This year I wrote six posts on this blog (including this one), which is fewer
than the ten written in 2020.  In the first half of the year I was looking for
a new job which sucked up most of my creative energy, but eventually last
Summer I [changed my employer][Pix4D].

Back in February I noticed how hard it is to know exactly what software
versions are installed in a container image and I proposed to [build container
images using Nix][NixContainers].  Nix is still the best tool for packaging and
deploying software and I use it everywhere I can.

On a rainy weekend in March I learned how to [generate random blog posts with a
Markov-chain][Markov].  This was great fun and in the future I'd like to
experiment more with various machine learning algorithms.

In June my mind was on [writing][Writing].  I reviewed two books which helped
me to improve my writing and I explained how I practice writing at work and in
my free time.

Finally, in December I spent my free time solving the [Advent of Code
2021][AoC] puzzles to learn the Clojure programming language.

Thanks for being here, let's see what 2022 brings!

Happy New Year!
