Day 6: Arrival
--------------

We arrived to Izmir airport from `Istanbul
<|filename|2013-05-30-Istanbul.rst>`_, and rented a car from `Avis
<http://www.avis.com>`_.  We had reserved the room in the `Eskişehir
Pansiyon <http://eskisehirpansiyon.com>`_, a small family hotel in
Güzelcamlı_, about 2 hours drive from Izmir.

The hospitality in the hotel is absolutely great.  Since it was off-season
we were the only guests in the house.  We learned from our host, Sefer, that
he used to be a teacher in the city of Eskişehir_ and, when retired, he and
his wife moved to Güzelcamlı to open the hotel.

In the remainder of the day we went to take a bath in the nearby sea.

Day 7: Beach (Operation Lobster)
--------------------------------

Sunbathing on the beach all day.  In the neighbouring `national park`_ there
are four very nice beaches, out of which we visited two.  Wild boars living
in the national park's forests come to the shore to be fed by tourists.  We
heard from a local guy that sometimes they steal unattended bagpacks hoping
to find some delicious treats in it.   They are not afraid of people at all,
if you speak the secret call *Mef-mef-mef* (which translates to "I would be
delighted to offer you this tasty piece of sandwich" in boarian), they
approach you gently.

Not putting on any suncream, by the end of the day I, a.k.a. *Mr
I-don't-need-freaking-suncream*, become lobster red.  Smart move.

Day 8: Hike in the National Park
--------------------------------

Today is hiking day.  We take the dolmuş_ to the national park and over the
course of a 5 hour hike we cross the `Dilek Peninsula`.  The environment is
really beautiful: at the highest point of the trail you can see water all
around you: the Mediterranean Sea to north and the Aegean Sea to south.
Around 2-3pm the heat in the direct sun gets unbearable.  Moreover, due to
the yesterday's sunburn my shoulders have great difficulty supporting the
weight of my backpack.

The vegetation is really interesting and changes very rapidly, depending on
the altitude and the orientation of the hills.

Also, a great number of animals species live in the national park.  During
the day we encounter all kinds of them.

Day 9: Leaving & Priene
-----------------------

We're leaving this likeable village and continue driving to south.  Before
we hit the state road, we pay a visit to the ruins of Priene_, which is
really close to Güzelcamlı.

After the visit, it takes 4 hours to get to Datça and the vacation is not
over just yet.
