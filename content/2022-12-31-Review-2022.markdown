title: Year 2022 in review
---

This year I wrote only three articles (including this one), so this will be a
short review of the articles in 2022.

The puzzle of Day 8 in [2021 Advent of Code][Aoc2021] inspired me to [explore
logic programming][LogicProgramming], a lesser known, perhaps forgotten, yet
powerful programming paradigm.  In this article I explain my first logic
program and I discuss the advantages and drawbacks I see with the
implementation.  I want to learn more about this paradigm because, as [Scott
Wlaschin explains in this presentation][40languages], logic programming systems
and libraries may yield elegant declarative solutions to some classes of
problems.

In Summer, I started to volunteer at [Powerhouse][Powerhouse], a local
organization helping people to learn programming.  I held only a few coaching
sessions, but the experience rekindled my interest in teaching.  I keep working
with them in next year too.

Finally, yet again, in December I spent my free time solving the [Advent of
Code][AoC2022] puzzles.

Thanks for reading and happy 2023!
