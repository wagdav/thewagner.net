title: My note-taking process
---

I began taking notes around age ten in primary school.  Though my teachers
certainly instructed us to do so, I don't remember if anyone actually taught me
_how_ to take notes.  Like the rest of the class, I studied and revised using
them.  I followed the teacher's explanations with a pen in my hand, jotting
down words, sentences, and diagrams in my notebook.  I maintained this habit
during my entire studies.  Still today, I prefer to follow a lecture while
taking notes.

I view this in-class note-taking as a one-step process: I capture the teacher's
words on paper and the notes become directly usable for revising.

           "In-class note-taking produces notes that I can directly use for
           revising.")

When [I write at work][BlogWriting], I produce a lot of notes. For example,
during a meeting I capture the salient points of a discussion, but the
resulting notes, in their raw form, only make sense to me and to none of my
co-workers.  A meeting possesses much less structure than a university lecture,
the messy, somewhat unreadable in-meeting notes require an extra pass to render
them usable.

When I read a technical text, I take notes.  I don't underline or highlight
words in books; instead, I jot down the interesting word or concept together
with the page number.  Later, I go back to each notes' page and form a complete
sentence about the concept or idea.

A few years ago, reading [How to Take Smart Notes][SmartNotes] by SÃ¶nke Ahrens
made me think about my own note-taking process which now involves three kinds
of notes:

* _Fleeting note_: temporary reminder of an idea, thought, or piece of
  information.
* _Project note_: information relevant to achieve a specific goal, often
  involving other people.
* _Permanent note_: distilled ideas and arguments that form the core of a
  knowledge base.

The process still starts with the capture step, but it contains two more steps
which produce the project and permanent notes:

Let's see each step in detail.

# Capture

During the _capture_ step I write down any relevant information I want to hold
on for later.  I already mentioned writing meeting or literature notes; I jot
down anything that switches on that light bulb above my head. The capture
transforms an intangible idea into a fleeting note.

Since my school days, my capture method remained essentially the same.
Depending on my mood I draft words, create lists, or sketch shapes and arrows.
I don't follow any particular system; I characterize my technique as a mix of
linear and visual note-taking.

I haven't seen two people take notes the same way so I suspect any method that
produces legible written text yields usable fleeting notes.
[Wikipedia][WikiNoteTaking] and many note-taking application vendors frame
note-taking as this capture step.

Capturing fleeting notes became almost automatic to me, but this step alone
doesn't produce useful notes.  I now believe the notes' value only emerges when
I do a second pass over my fleeting notes.

# Who, What, When, Where, Why

The activity, which I name after the [Five Ws of journalism][WikiFiveWs],
starts if a fleeting note belongs to a project.  As David Allen explains in
[Getting Things Done][WikiGtd] you cannot _do_ a project, you can only do
actions that bring you closer to the project's goals.  When processing a
project-relevant fleeting note, I identify actions and define the project's
next action.

In my personal system, I maintain a list of actions per project; the next
action appears as the first element.  At work, I store the project notes in
whatever system the team chooses.  The implementation doesn't matter as long as
the note reaches the people involved.

# Rephrase

If a note doesn't relate to a specific project, I write a _permanent note_ and
store it in my reference system.  These notes come in different kinds including
data sheets, manuals, literature review, definitions, and outlines.

For example, I keep a list of tools I require for replacing my bike's break
pads and a note detailing [Git](https://git-scm.com) commands I use
infrequently. I have notes about concepts and ideas from articles and
conference talks, and I draft summaries of books I read.

Initially, I tried to segregate the different note kinds, but now I simply
place every non-project related note in a single system.

Most fleeting notes demand work to reach the reference system.  I rephrase the
recorded concept using my own words.  I write full sentences in one or two
paragraphs, preferably in active voice, and I avoid lists and bullet points.
For example, my permanent note about Paul Graham's essay  _Writes and Write
Nots_ reads as follows:

> In his essay [Writes and Write Nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html) Paul
> Graham, predicts that in couple of decades most people will loose their
> ability to write.  Clear writing requires clear thinking which makes writing
> fundamentally hard.  When you have a more prestigious job, you require to
> write more.
>
> Today generative AI tools may write for you, but they don't to the thinking
> part.  Paul Graham's prediction that the world will split into those who
> write and those who "write not".  Following his previous argument, this
> means we will have a split between "thinks" and "think nots".

It took me only a few minutes to write these two paragraphs.  I can immediately
recall why this article resonated with me and explain it using my own words to
other people if I want to.

I admit, not all my notes look like this; sometimes I cannot find better words
than the original.  Sometimes I just copy over my fleeting notes and move on,
but when I skip the rephrase step I know I don't get the most out my notes.

# Summary

In the past few years I adopted a two-step note-taking process.  I capture
ideas as fleeting notes.  For projects, I extract next actions from the
fleeting note and record a permanent note in a system the project team can
access.  Otherwise, I rephrase the fleeting note using my own words to create a
permanent note, which I store in a reference system.
