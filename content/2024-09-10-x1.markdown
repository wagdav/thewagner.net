title: NixOS on the Lenovo Carbon X1 (Gen 12)
---

My new [Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 12][X1] arrived today.  I plan to use this
computer as my personal workstation for the coming years. I've been watching
the evolution of the X1 Carbon series for a while; I was convinced that this
is the right model for me.  I don't need extreme performance and I appreciate
its small size and light structure.

The new X1 replaces a [Lenovo X230][X230] which I used for twelve years.  The
hardware is still in a good shape and the battery lasts for a few hours. But
it's just too slow even for browsing the Internet.

[I run NixOS][Homelab] on every computer I own and the new X1 is no exception.
In a few minutes I could replicate my current configuration on the new laptop.
On the X1 I decided to use [ZFS][ZFS], a file system I like to learn more
about.  Also, the disk partitioning scheme is now [defined
declaratively][Homelab-x1] using [disko][disko].

When I first booted NixOS 24.05 with its default 6.6 LTS kernel, the HDMI port
and the sound didn't work.  I tried a few more recent kernel versions and I
found that since version 6.8.12 everything works.  Currently my system runs
6.10.2.
