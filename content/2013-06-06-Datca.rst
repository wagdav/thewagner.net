Day 9: Arrival
--------------

We arrive in the late afternoon to `Datça` from `Güzelcamlı
<|filename|2013-06-02-Guzelcamli.rst>`_ .  We check-in at the `Tunç
Pansiyon` and walk to the nearest beach (5 mins) to swim a bit.  It's the
perfect place to create a mini `zen garden`_.

We have dinner in `Zekerya Sofrasi`_, a small family restaurant.  It's like
a fast-food restaurant: the dished are ready and kept warm.  The selection
is small and very delicious.

Day 10: Knidos and beach
------------------------

We drive till the tip of the Datça peninsula.  On the way we're stopped by
two elderly women: from their gestures we understand that they want a lift
to the next village.  They hop in and talk to us not being bothered by the
fact that we don't understand a single word.

In `Knidos`_ there's a museum of the ruins of an ancient city, but we don't
visit it because the ticket is rather expensive and according to the guide
it's not really worth it.  Instead, we try to find a deserted beach where we
can spend some hours sunbathing.  The shoreline is quite rocky and steep, it
takes a while finding a safe path to hike down to the sea.  Well, *safe
path* kind of looses its meaning when you're wearing flip-flops/sandals.

We take a scenic road on the way back to Datça and we stop at different
beaches to look around and swim a bit here and there.

Day 11: Kargı-bay
-----------------

We spend most of the day on the beach of the nearby Kargı-bay.  In the
afternoon we visit some old windmills (at least their remainings) and the
city center of Eski Datça (Old Datça).

Day 12: Boat-trip
-----------------

We take a boat trip that lasts all day.  The ship goes along the coast and
stops in bays not accessible from the land.  At every stop we take a swim in
the crystal clear, though coldish water.

Day 13: Leaving
---------------

We're leaving Datça and drive to `Selçuk
<|filename|/2013-06-08-Selcuk.rst>`_ which will be the last city we visit
during this trip.  On the way we stop at the ruins of `Alinda
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alinda>`_.  There is no museum, no entry fee,
in fact, there is nobody here but us.  Perhaps the excavations had not
revealed here anything important and they did not spend money for
reconstruction and maintenance.  However, it is clear, from what remained,
that once there was a great, busy city here.
