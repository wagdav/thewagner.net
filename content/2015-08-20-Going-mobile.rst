Going mobile

This is an experimental post, sort of proof of principle, to see how comfortable it is to write blog posts from my mobile phone.  Maybe I should have called it `hello world <{filename}2013-03-06-hello-world.rst>`_ from Android.

Ingredients
-----------

1. **Git based workflow** I write the posts and `generate the blog <{filename}2013-08-09-Git-workflow.rst>`_ on my laptop (using GitHub pages).

2. **Git client on my phone**. After a bit of research I quickly settled with `PocketGit <http://pocketgit.com>`_. It is not for free, but costs only 1.79 CHF and, according to the reviews, this is the best Android client you can get.

3. **An editor**. Since on the desktop I use vim for everything I gave `Vim Touch <https://github.com/momodalo/vimtouch>`_ a shot, but was not convinced.  For now I installed the `Quoda code editor <http://getquoda.com>`_. So far so good, we will see how I like it.

Setup
-----

There was really nothing unusual to do.  Only PocketGit only needed some additional configuration.  I generated an SSH key pair to be used by my phone to access the remote Git repositories.  The rest of the infrastructure was already in place.

Conclusion
----------

This first post entirely written on my Android phone is about to finish.  It took me only about an hour to configure everything and I am overall happy with this tool chain.

Typing on my small phone is a bit painful but I think I can get use to it (otherwise I have to buy a phablet or suchlike).  I will keep publishing the posts only from my laptop where I can comfortably spell check, polish and integrate the changes I made into the master branch. Also my `blog generator <http://getpelican.com>`_ does not run on Android, but this is not an issue at all.
