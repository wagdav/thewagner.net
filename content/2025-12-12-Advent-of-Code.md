title: Advent of Code 2025
summary: Solving the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles in Clojure.
---

This year, [again][AoC2024], December starts with the [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.  Eric Wastl
[announced][RedditComment] that from this year the puzzle series last only 12
days instead of the 25.  In the previous years I felt exhausted by the end of
the month so I don't mind that this year ends earlier.

# Puzzles

Between December 1 and December 12, a programming puzzle appears every day on
the Advent of Code website.  Each problem has two parts, the second part
unlocks after you complete the first.  To understand each day's puzzle, go to
the website and read the full description (for example [Day 1: Secret
Entrance](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1)).

**Spoiler alert**: If you still plan to work on the puzzles, stop reading now.

# Highlights

For the sixth consequtive year, I write my solutions in Clojure.  Since I don't
use this language professionally, I look forward to coding in Clojure every
December.  Usually, I solved the day's problem before leaving to work, though
sometimes I polished my code in the evening.

I sought external help to solve the second parts of [Day 7][Day07] and [Day
10][Day10] and I haven't yet started [Day 12][Day12].  The other days went
smoothly.  I particularly enjoyed [Day 6][Day06] which required reading the
input file from right to left, to satisfy to the Elf's clumsy specification.

You can find my solutions on [GitHub][Repo].
