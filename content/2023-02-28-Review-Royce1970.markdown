title: Managing the development of large software systems
---

This is a review of the paper [Managing the development of large systems by
Winston W. Royce][PDF], originally published in August 1970.

Figure 2 of this paper often cited as the ["waterfall" method][WikiWaterfall],
a model that considers the project's activities as a linear sequence of steps.
In fact, this figure is only the starting point of paper.  Royce acknowledges
that the depicted model _doesn't work_ in practice and he suggests five
concrete steps that are required for large software projects to succeed.

# Analysis and coding

The paper starts with the observation that there are two essential steps common
to all computer program development: analysis and coding.

![Figure1]({static}/images/royce1970-figure1.png "Figure 1. Implementation
steps to deliver a small computer program for internal operations.")

The author doesn't discuss these steps in detail.  I understand the first step
as analysis of the problem at hand and the second as the activity spent typing
in the code, debugging, and deploying.  In other words, first we define what
the desired program is indented to do, then we implement it.

Royce claims that this simple, two-step development model works for systems
where the final product is operated by the those who built it.  The rest of the
paper extends this model to explain the development of larger systems:

> _"[...] to manufacture larger software systems [...] additional development
> steps are required, none contribute as directly to the final product as
> analysis and coding, and all drive up the development costs."_

We will see later that by _additional development steps_ the author means
program design, defining requirements, writing documentation and testing.  It
seems that in already in 1970 many people didn't understand that a software
project is much more than just coding:

> _"Customer personnel typically would rather not pay for them [the additional
> steps], and development personnel would rather not implement them.  The prime
> function of management is to sell these concepts to both groups."_

Nevertheless, Royce holds the management responsible to explain the structure
of the project and the purpose of each step in it.

The author managed the _"development of software packages for spacecraft
mission planning, commanding and post-flight analysis"_.  Drawn from the
author's experience, the paper proposes a development model that is required,
but not sufficient, for a such software project to succeed.

In the sixties the most expensive and most complex software projects solved
scientific and engineering problems, often using hardware with constrained
resources.  Royce clearly makes his claims in this specific context, so perhaps
it's foolish to extrapolate to the development of _any_ software project.

# Not waterfall

The third paragraph introduces the "additional steps" the author hinted in the
introduction:

> _"A more grandiose approach to software development is illustrated in Figure
> 2.  The analysis and coding steps are still in the picture, but they are
> preceded by two levels of requirements analysis, are separated by a program
> design step, and followed by a testing step."_

![Figure2]({static}/images/royce1970-figure2c.png "Figure 2. Implementation
steps to develop a large computer program for delivery to a customer.")

Looking from the manager's perspective, Royce continues:

> _"These additions are treated separately from analysis and coding because
> they are distinctly different in the way they are executed. They must be
> planned and staffed differently for best utilization of program resources."_

The nature of the work in these steps is different, so it makes sense to think
about them separately.  Royce doesn't specify how these steps are executed.  In
fact, he doesn't discuss this figure any further because this is just an
intermediate step, and he's not finished presenting his model yet.

# Local iterations are insufficient

In Figure 3, Royce shows an iterative relationship between successive
development steps.

![Figure3]({static}/images/royce1970-figure3c.png "Hopefully, the iterative
interactions between the various phases is confined to successive steps.")

Royce believes in this approach.  He thinks these small, local iterations have
value because:

> _"[...] as each step progresses and the design is further detailed [...] The
> virtue of all of this is that as the design proceeds the change process is
> scoped down to manageable limits."_

Adapting the design in small chunks has benefits, but he immediately points out
that the following this process is _"risky and invites failure"_.  The problem
is that iterations only occur between preceding and succeeding steps but rarely
in more remote steps in the sequence.  Royce gives an example:

> _"The testing phase which occurs at the end of the development cycle is the
> first event for which timing, storage, input/output transfers, etc., are
> experienced as distinguished from analyzed. [...] if these phenomena fail to
> satisfy the various external constraints, then invariably a major redesign is
> required."_

With local iterations only, fundamental design problems surface too late in the
project.  In effect, the development costs increase and the project runs late.

Before discussing the mitigations, Royce closes this section with a note on the
role of coding:

> _"One might note that there has been a skipping-over of the analysis and code
> phases.  One cannot, of course, produce software without these steps, but
> generally these phases are managed with relative ease and have little impact
> on requirements, design, and testing."_

It is not implementation,  but discovering the requirements, finding a solid
design and defining a test plan are the risky parts of the process.

# Eliminate development risks

In the main part of the paper Royce presents five steps that, in his
experience, increase the likelihood of success.  These are:

1. Program design comes first
1. Document the design
1. Do it twice
1. Plan, control and monitor testing
1. Involve the customer

The process is shown in Figure 4, let's see each steps in detail.

![Figure4]({static}/images/royce1970-figure4c.png "Unfortunately, for the
process illustrated, the design iterations are never confined to the
successive steps")

## Program design comes first

In center of Figure 4 is "Program design", this is where the process starts.
Program designers lay out the operational design of the program, they _design,
define and allocate data processing modes even at the risk of being wrong_.

Eventually, all software is about data transformation therefore [understanding
the data][ActonCppcon] is key to understanding the problem.  The recommendation
here is detailed and prescriptive:

> _"Allocate processing, functions, design the database, define database
> processing, allocate execution time, define interfaces and processing modes
> with the operating system, describe input and output processing, and define
> preliminary operating procedures."_

The outcome of this phase is an overview document with a goal that:

> _"Each and every worker must have an elemental understanding of the system.
> At least one person must have a deep understanding of the system which comes
> partially from having had to write an overview document."_

Interestingly, in his [1980 Turing-award lecture][Hoare1980], Tony Hoare
recounts a story of a cancelled project from the sixties where he felt
responsible for the failure because he let the programmers do things which
himself didn't understand.

## Document the design

Royce starts the longest section of the paper with a categorical statement:

> _"The first rule of managing software development is ruthless enforcement of
> documentation requirements. [...] Management of software is simply impossible
> without a high degree of documentation."_

A verbal record is intangible to be a basis for a communication interface or
management decision.  Without a written record one cannot evaluate the
project's progress nor its completion.

Documentation serves as the primary means of communication between people on
different parts of the project: developers, testers, people in operations.
Additionally, good documentation permits effective redesign, updating and
retrofitting without throwing away the entire existing framework of operating
software.

How much documentation is enough?  According to Royce, in 5 million dollar
(approximately 38 million in 2023) software project, an adequate specification
document would be around 1500 pages long.

## Do it twice

If the product is totally original, Royce recommends building a prototype which
he calls an _early simulation of the final product_:

> _"If the computer program in question is being developed for the first time,
> arrange matters so that the version finally delivered to the customer for
> operational deployment is actually the second version insofar as critical
> design/operations areas are concerned."_

The goal of the prototype is to test which hypotheses hold and identify areas of
the design which are too optimistic.  Royce highlights that the personnel
involved in the pilot must have _an intuitive feel for analysis, coding and
program design_.  In other words, the most experienced engineers in the team
should be assigned to this work.

## Plan, control and monitor testing

This part on testing is the second-longest section of the paper, here I
highlight only a few points.

If the project followed the previous steps, most problems should be already
solved:

> _"The previous three recommendations to design the program before beginning
> analysis and coding, to document it completely, and to build a pilot model
> are all aimed at uncovering and solving problems before entering the test
> phase."_

In this section Royce observes that most errors are obvious, and he argues for
performing code reviews: _every bit of code should be subjected to a simple
visual scan by a second party who did not do the original analysis or code._

He also promotes good test coverage: _every logic path in the computer program
at least once with some kind of numerical check_.  He puts the bar high: as a
customer he would insist on nearly 100% coverage.

## Involve the customer

Royce recognizes that even after an agreement, what the desired software is
going to do is a subject of wide interpretation.  He suggests that the customer
is formally involved during design reviews and during the final software
acceptance review.

# Discussion

I am surprised how many ideas, that we consider as "modern", are present in
this paper from 1970.  Designing data flows, pilot projects, code reviews,
customer involvement are all mentioned here by someone who managed projects
during the sixties.  Computing was totally different then, but software
projects suffered the same problem as today.

More than fifty years later, I feel that the Royce's wisdom remains relevant.
Many suggestions in this paper were rediscovered or reformulated later, perhaps
some are still ignored.

This is a fantastic paper.  The [original][PDF] is only 11 pages, I highly
recommend reading it.
