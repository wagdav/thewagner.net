title: Year 2025 in review
---

The first quarter of the year I trained again for the [20 km of Lausanne][20km]
where I beat my 2024 personal best.  In May, I joined a few friends for [a week
of gravel cycling][Gravel] through the hills of Tuscany.

# Articles

In February, I described our use of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit][CDK] at my
new job.  I believe I found a right length and format to explain why this tool
helps me building cloud infrastructure.

In May, I [published an anniversary post for my Homelab][Homelab5].  For five
years I manage my own home infrastructure with Nix which makes me proud and
happy.

In October, I analyzed [my note taking progress][Notes] and explained how a
two-step process helps me to write great notes.  I also
[reviewed][NormalAccidents] Charles Perrow's _Normal Accidents_.

Finally, as in the past few years, in December I spent my free time solving the
[Advent of Code][AoC2025] puzzles.

# Tech

I spent some time exploring the [NATS](https://www.nats.io) communication
system and the [Replicant](https://replicant.fun/) library for building web
applications.  I hope I'll have an opportunity to integrate them into future
projects.

# Books

Many years ago a friend of mine gifted me _The Making of the Atomic Bomb_ by
Richard Rhodes.  I cannot recall why I waited so long to open it, I finally
read it this summer. In just a few days I consumed Andy Weir's _Hail Mary
Project_. To finish the year, I spent my Christmas reading Bertrand Meyer's
_Agile!_.

Thanks for reading my blog and happy 2026!
