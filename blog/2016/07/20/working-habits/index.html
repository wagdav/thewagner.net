    <div class="content" style="hyphens:auto">
      <p>Inarguably <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">David Allen&#8217;s Getting Things Done</a> had the great influence on me in developing an efficient working routine.  I have implemented my own system based on the book which works well for me most of the times.  Interestingly, <span class="caps">GTD</span> also taught me what I should <em>not</em> do, and when things go less great I am noticing it in a short&nbsp;time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Maybe this should be a whole project rather than a&nbsp;task?</em></li>
<li><em>Is this item is really&nbsp;actionable?</em></li>
<li><em>Was there any progress on this project&nbsp;recently?</em></li>
<li>&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>When these questions arise, it&#8217;s an indication that something needs to be changed.  Actually, most of the time they signal that some <em>thinking</em> is needed before&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>A key aspect of getting things done is a distraction free environment.  You can have the best task system ever, if the phone always rings, message notifications pop up, projects will never move forward.  I&#8217;d already recognized some points to improve in my working habits during my PhD, but I&#8217;ve been trying to shape my working environment more consciously since I started working in&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>Here are some tools I use, techniques I implemented during the last years to support a good <span class="caps">GTD</span> work flow.  Most of the my work happens before the computer, so some of the points following are rather&nbsp;specific.</p>
<p>So here are my tips (for myself and&nbsp;you):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Avoid&nbsp;distractions</li>
<li>Be&nbsp;asynchronous</li>
<li>Be&nbsp;responsive</li>
<li>Be&nbsp;distributed</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s see each point in&nbsp;detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="avoid-distractions">
<h2>Avoid&nbsp;distractions</h2>
<p>As stated earlier this is the most important point.  Distractions destroy&nbsp;productivity.</p>
<div class="section" id="solid-black-desktop">
<h3>Solid black&nbsp;desktop</h3>
<p>I used to tinker a lot with desktop widgets, I loved to put email notifications, clocks, cool backgrounds, nice window decorations, etc. on my desktop.  Now they are all gone, they&#8217;re good for nothing but distractions.  My desktop has solid black color, no icons or anything at&nbsp;all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tiling-is-great">
<h3>Tiling is&nbsp;great</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m using a tiling window manager (<a class="reference external" href="http://xmonad.org">XMonad</a>) which helps me to keep my applications organized.  I can only see the windows I need for what I&#8217;m working on.  My task bar is very small and only shows the most essential&nbsp;information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="at-most-two-screens">
<h3>At most two&nbsp;screens</h3>
<p>These days it&#8217;s common to have a workstation with two, three or even more screens.  I used to love screens a lot myself: the more the better, I thought.  It turns out that more screens just provide more space for&nbsp;distractions.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>On this screen I will always keep my mail client open.</em></blockquote>
<p>I used to think.  Well, that&#8217;s basically the same thing as having an annoying &#8220;You&#8217;ve got mail&#8221; notification on the desktop. Very&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<p>At work, my workstation has two screens, which is sufficient for me. Two screen provides reasonable arrangements for most of my work flows.  For example I can&nbsp;keep:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>code and&nbsp;documentation,</li>
<li>code and testing/debugging&nbsp;outputs,</li>
<li>browser and mail&nbsp;client</li>
</ul>
<p>comfortably next to each other.  At home I use my laptop without external screens.  Thanks to my window manager I can switch almost instantaneously between virtual desktops, so I don&#8217;t feel limited by its relatively small, 12.5&#8221;&nbsp;screen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-asynchronous">
<h2>Be&nbsp;asynchronous</h2>
<p>Most of these ideas I learned from a series of blog posts explaining <a class="reference external" href="https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works/">How GitHub Works</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="prefer-email-to-phone">
<h3>Prefer email to&nbsp;phone</h3>
<p>I prefer email to phone.  Receiving an email is not a distraction for me (see my comment on email notifications above) while a phone call is.  I can read and answer emails when I want, at the time and location where I feel like dealing with&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Of course there are good reasons to call: the feedback is immediate, the discussion is more personal, conveying a message may be easier.  Still, most people prefer to call because they fear that the other person might not read their emails or forget to answer.  Indeed, most people haven&#8217;t got the slightest clue how to deal with their email.  The result is: emails get lost and forgotten so people think <em>Maybe I should just call&nbsp;instead&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Calls and email can co-exist very naturally: calls can be organized over email.  Fix a time then discuss what&#8217;s needed.  In fact, this way the phone call effectively turns into a meeting.  More on meetings in the next&nbsp;section.</p>
<p>Also email is only good as a communication tool if emails get answered, that is if the use of email comes with certain responsiveness.  I&#8217;ll return to this point too&nbsp;later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prefer-documentation-to-meetings">
<h3>Prefer documentation to&nbsp;meetings</h3>
<p>Just Google the terms &#8220;why meetings are bad&#8221; or &#8220;how to have good meetings&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see my point.  The bottom line is that meetings are super expensive and very&nbsp;inefficient.</p>
<p>When I need to distribute knowledge I prefer to write documentation.  No, not that kind of documentation everybody hates writing.  I write a couple of lines on our company wiki or issue tracker, send a link around and ask people to read and ask questions or, even better, directly edit it if something is not&nbsp;clear.</p>
<p>Short essays, structured documents such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">RFCs</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">PEPs</a> are great to convey a proposal or an idea.  These documents can be distributed, discussed and enhanced over email and no boring meetings are required.  They don&#8217;t have to be super formal to be useful: the time spent on just gathering the words together helps to get out something solid out of the thinking&nbsp;process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-responsive">
<h2>Be&nbsp;responsive</h2>
<p>Asynchronous communication as mentioned before does not work without trust.  People will bother you on the phone (or through other synchronous channels) if they fear that you won&#8217;t take the time to read your e-mails or review the documents you received.  Trust can be build by being <em>responsive</em>.  If people develop trust in me and learn that they will get a response from me in time, it helps them to adapt their work flows to&nbsp;mine.</p>
<p>I try to answer my e-mails in a &#8216;reasonable&#8217; time.  It depends on the context what this&nbsp;means:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>work related mails I try to answer within a&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>a mail from a friend a subject &#8216;how is it going&#8217; will be answered in a couple of&nbsp;days.</li>
</ul>
<p>It happens that an email stays unanswered for a longer period of time, but most of the time it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t take the time to do it (which effectively means, because I was lazy) not because it was lost or forgotten.  I use the &#8216;Inbox Zero&#8217; strategy (the term coined by Merlin Mann) to handle my mails using a super simple system named &#8216;Trusted Trio&#8217; adopted from <a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/182318/empty-your-inbox-with-the-trusted-trio">Lifehacker</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="be-distributed">
<h2>Be&nbsp;distributed</h2>
<p>Stuff gets done at physically different locations.  For me these locations are: work, home and when I&#8217;m on the go.  For example, it can happen that in the office during the day I take some notes that I need in the evening at home to complete a certain task.  This means that my notes need to be distributed among all my places of work and they need to be accessible <em>without too much effort</em>.  In <span class="caps">GTD</span> terms: my reference material needs to be accessible from different&nbsp;contexts.</p>
<p>More&nbsp;specifically:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It&#8217;s a commonplace, but I can access my e-mails from&nbsp;anywhere.</li>
<li>I synchronize my browser bookmarks and history using Firefox, so I can save interesting sites for reading them later, somewhere&nbsp;else.</li>
<li>My configuration files are stored <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wagdav/rcfiles">on GitHub</a> so I can access them from all my work&nbsp;stations.</li>
<li>My notes are in a text file in a Dropbox&nbsp;folder.</li>
<li>My task list is kept in sync by <a class="reference external" href="https://taskwarrior.org">Taskwarrior</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d like to improve on my current setup to make my personal data, such as pictures, documents, etc. more accessible when I&#8217;m not home (only for myself in a secure manner
of course).  Maybe I write a post about this some other&nbsp;time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I try to shape my working habits to get my stuff done in the most efficient manner.  I identified four principles (no distractions, asynchronous communication, responsiveness and distribution) which can help me to achieve&nbsp;this.</p>
