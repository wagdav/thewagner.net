    <div class="content" style="hyphens:auto">
      <p>In the past years I have been learning about technical writing.  In this article
I review two books that helped me to improve my writing skills. Then, I present
how I practice writing at home and at&nbsp;work.</p>
<h1>Discovering&nbsp;writing</h1>
<p>As a scientist I published technical reports, journal papers and even a 200
pages long <a href="https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/186309">doctoral thesis</a>, but I knew little about <em>writing</em>, a
communication skill that can be learned and improved.  I left academia and I
got a job as a software engineer.  I stopped following science and started
learning programming languages and study industry best&nbsp;practices.</p>
<p>One summer I read <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework"><span class="caps">REWORK</span></a>, a book written by Basecamp&#8217;s founders.  The
chapter <em>Hire great writers</em> explains the authors&#8217; preference in hiring
candidates who can demonstrate great writing skills because clear and efficient
written communication is essential in their distributed and asynchronous
working style.  I was an employee and I didn&#8217;t plan to hire anybody, but the
emphasis on high-quality writing inspired me to become a better&nbsp;writer.</p>
<p>I looked at my own <a href="https://thewagner.net/blog/2016/07/20/working-habits/">working habits</a>
and, somewhat naively, realized the obvious: <em>I write all the time</em>.  Instant
messaging, code commits, pull-requests, code reviews, project proposals,
incident reports are all a form of writing.  I wanted to learn what good
writing is and how to write&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>I searched for resources targeted at  practitioners who write technical text.
In the next sections I present two books from which I learned the&nbsp;most.</p>
<h1>Book: <span class="caps">BUGS</span> In&nbsp;Writing</h1>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BUGS-Writing-Revised-Guide-Debugging/dp/020137921X"><span class="caps">BUGS</span> In Writing by Lyn Dupré</a> is a catalog of common
mistakes.  It comprises short, easily digestible segments.  Each segment
presents a principle to make your technical writing clear and lucid.  The
principles are illustrated by witty example phrases and numerous cat&nbsp;photos.</p>
<p>I encountered this book through a reference in Chris Okasaki&#8217;s thesis <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf">Purely
Functional Data Structures</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was extremely fortunate to have had excellent English teachers in high
school. Lori Huenink deserves special recognition; her writing and public
speaking classes are undoubtedly the most valuable classes I have ever taken,
in any subject. In the same vein, I was lucky enough to read my wife&#8217;s copy
of Lyn Dupré&#8217;s <span class="caps">BUGS</span> in Writing just as I was starting my thesis. If your
career involves writing in any form, you owe it to yourself to buy a copy of
this&nbsp;book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read this recommendation I immediately ordered a copy.  <em><span class="caps">BUGS</span> in
Writing</em> is a fantastic handbook.  When I have doubts about a specific word or
expression I search for advise in the&nbsp;book.</p>
<p>To give a taste of Dupré&#8217;s style, here&#8217;s an example from the segment <em>Impact</em>,
where you learn about the one of the most overused, ugly words in the English&nbsp;language:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only two pleasing uses of <em>impact</em>: to denote a forceful collision,
and to mean packed or wedged&nbsp;in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the principle is&nbsp;that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&#8230;] you should not use <em>impact</em> when you mean <em>influence</em> or <em>effect</em>, and
you certainly should not use <em>impact</em> when you mean <em>affect</em>, because
impacting people is incredibly&nbsp;impolite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you learn about such principles you develop ear for detecting bugs in
texts and your tolerance for buzzwords and corporate jargon&nbsp;decreases.</p>
<h1>Book: On Writing&nbsp;Well</h1>
<p>William Zinsser <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548">On Writing Well</a> is really what its subtitle
claims: the classic guide to writing nonfiction.  This book showed me how a
professional writer thinks about writing methods, style, structure and genres.
The book has a chapter on writing about science and technology, but it also
treats business writing, writing about arts, sports and even&nbsp;memoirs.</p>
<p>Zinsser warns about clutter, every piece of text that doesn&#8217;t do useful work.
He suggests stripping every sentence to its barest bones: delete pompous words,
redundant adjectives, jargon and replace laborious phrases with short words
that mean the same&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>Writing a clean sentence is hard work.  And the work is non-linear and
iterative: <em>rewriting is the essence of writing</em> as Zinsser puts&nbsp;it.</p>
<h1>Writing a&nbsp;blog</h1>
<p>In 2013 I published the <a href="https://thewagner.net/blog/2013/03/06/hello-world/">first article</a> on this blog. I wanted to
write, but I didn&#8217;t know what to write about.  A common dilemma of the aspiring
writer.  In a few years I published a handful of short articles on random
topics.  Some of them were meta-articles on <a href="https://thewagner.net/blog/2013/03/08/pelican-up-and-running/">setting up this
blog</a>.  Some were as simple as connecting a <a href="https://thewagner.net/blog/2013/06/26/led-and-button/"><span class="caps">LED</span> and a
button</a> to a Raspberry Pi.  Unexpectedly, I had a few &#8220;hits&#8221; too: many
friends liked the article on <a href="https://thewagner.net/blog/2016/07/20/working-habits/">my working habits</a>.</p>
<p>Around 2017 I changed my writing strategy.  Instead of overthinking the subject
of my next article, I decided that my hobby projects should end with an entry
on my blog.  While working on a project I take notes and write outlines.  When
I&#8217;m finished (or bored) I have a seed of a new article.  I still have to work
hard to make my notes into a coherent story, but I feel that the goal, the
published article, is&nbsp;reachable.</p>
<h1>Writing at&nbsp;work</h1>
<p>In my team we improve code using pull-requests, changes that typically comprise
few dozen to few hundred lines of code.  We prefer small batches of code
changes that are easy to review.  The risk of breaking existing systems is
lower than if we changed everything at once.  But through these incremental
changes it&#8217;s hard to see the context in which a given pull-request makes&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>I felt the team needed a document that shows how each code change fits into the
story of the project.  Earlier, my team had considered writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_request">change request
documents</a> but some felt it bureaucratic and, frankly, we didn&#8217;t know how to
write them&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Last December at work I started a new project that required changes in many
subsystems.  I described my implementation plan on the company wiki.  In few
sentences I created a <em>design document</em>.</p>
<p>I started the implementation and as I learned more about the problem domain I
refined the design and I updated the document with my progress.  If you&#8217;d read
the document you would have known what&#8217;s been done and what&#8217;s left to do. The
wiki page became a <em>project page</em>.</p>
<p>Of course my initial design had holes and I discovered traps and dead ends.  I
recorded my failings on the same wiki page which evolved into an <em>experience
report</em>.</p>
<p>When I finished the implementation I collected instructions for operators, the
support team and for other developers, transforming the page into <em>project
documentation</em>.</p>
<p>A few months later when I reread this page I found a <em>historical record</em> that
explains why and how we arrived to state we have&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>During this process I found a few practices&nbsp;useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I rewrite the same document as we work on the project.  The document is
  always the entry point for all project-relevant&nbsp;information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I write prose with complete sentences to build context.  A few words with
  bullet points, list of ticket IDs are&nbsp;insufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I often reference related content.  There&#8217;s no need to repeat what&#8217;s
  explained&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I share every major revision with my colleagues asking for reviews and&nbsp;suggestions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The time spent evolving this page was worth it.  I felt that the state of the
page reflected the stage of the project.  If a project needs long pages to
explain, it&#8217;s too big.  If a few words can&#8217;t express what I&#8217;m doing, the
project is ill-defined, or I lack some knowledge to execute&nbsp;it.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I wrote during my whole career, but only lately I have been cultivating my
writing skills.  I practice writing in my free time and professionally.  I
document my hobby projects and software experiments on my blog and I write
&#8220;evolving&#8221; documents on the company&#8217;s internal&nbsp;wiki.</p>
