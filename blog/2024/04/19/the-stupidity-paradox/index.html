    <div class="content" style="hyphens:auto">
      <p>This is a review of the book <em>The Stupidity Paradox</em> by Mats Alvesson and
André Spicer which explores the role of functional stupidity in contemporary
organizations.</p>
<p>The authors' thesis is that functional stupidity is omnipresent, especially in
large firms, and it has a mix of positive and negative outcomes.  The paradox
is that presence of stupidity is not always bad, but it can have some benefits.</p>
<h1>Stupidity Today</h1>
<p>In the first part of the book the authors claim that predictions from the 1960s
about the arrival of knowledge-based economy still remains a promise.  The
reality is that only a small fraction of jobs are knowledge-intensive.  In
fact, contemporary organizations make many smart people do stupid things.</p>
<p>Functional stupidity is the absence of reflection on the purpose or the wider
context of a job.  You do the job correctly, focusing on the technical details
but stop searching for questions about the work.  Three aspects characterize
functional stupidity:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Lack of reflexivity</em>: You don't think about your assumptions.</li>
<li><em>Lack of justification</em>: You don't ask why you're doing something.</li>
<li><em>Lack of substantive reasoning</em>: You don't consider the consequences or
   wider meaning of your actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wishful thinking, following leaders without scrutiny, unreasoning zeal for fads
and fashions, senseless imitation of others and the use of clichés in place of
careful analysis are examples of functional stupidity.</p>
<p>In organizations a small amount of functional stupidity is beneficial.
Avoiding difficult conversations can help individuals to suppress their doubts,
be happy and feel comfortable with ambiguity.  Ignoring negative impulses help
to get along better with colleagues and provide a steady climb on the corporate
ladder.</p>
<p>But if people stop asking probing questions and ignore problems for too long,
functional stupidity can lead to larger problems and disasters.  People grow
cynical and alienated when they see a large discrepancy between proclaimed
values and actual work.</p>
<h1>Five kinds of Functional Stupidity</h1>
<p>The second part of the book explores five sources of functional stupidity which
are common in organizations, induced by leadership, structure, imitation,
branding and culture.</p>
<p><em>Leadership-induced stupidity</em>. When people develop an unquestioning faith in
their boss and in the magical powers of leadership.</p>
<p><em>Structure-induced stupidity</em>.  Formal processes and structures are required in
organizations but they don't guarantee quality, reliability and productivity.
People often blindly trust processes and systems which don't produce the
results they hope for.  The mixture of senior managers who mainly sit in
meetings talking to other managers, narrowly focused experts, and routinized
workers create organizations where rule-following trumps good results.</p>
<p><em>Imitation-induced stupidity</em>.  Managers often adopt structures and formal
practices that look good and not what makes the organization function more
efficiently.  This is to create an image which conforms to broadly shared
expectations of how an organization should be.  But a disconnect between the
organization's image and its everyday practices lead to frustration, low
commitment and cynicism.</p>
<p><em>Branding-induced stupidity</em>.  There is a massive overproduction in many parts
of the economy.  To dispose of this surplus we developed an economy of
persuasion.  Branding helps to transform the dull job of convincing people
about things they don't need or want into something that sounds exciting and
interesting.  But branding activities are often met with indifference and
cynicism.</p>
<p><em>Culture-induced stupidity</em>.  Corporate culture coordinates people, offers a
shared sense of purpose, creates a common identity and reduces conflicts and
confusion.  But culture always includes a degree of functional stupidity.  Most
organizations foster a culture of optimism, focusing on the present and being
change oriented.  But when you can't mention bad news you often can't adapt to
important changes.  If you don't look at the past you cannot learn from it. And
an organization that drifts from one change initiative to another without real
benefits becomes self-obsessed and gets harder to get actual work done.</p>
<h1>Stupidity management</h1>
<p>Although it's never presented explicitly, stupidity management, that is to
reduce thinking at work, is an important activity for managers. Again, small
amount of functional stupidity can be advantageous because too much thinking
can lead to conflicts, uncertainties, doubts and reduced motivation.</p>
<p>The third part enumerates four ways managers encourage functional stupidity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Authority</em>: Manager use their formal position in the hierarchy to make
  subordinates follow polices and orders.  The hope for a reward or the fear of
  punishment discourages staff from thinking too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Seduction</em>: Managers enlist attractive ideas and arrangements to persuade
  people. It's often about arguing that change is always good and about
  painting a rosy picture of the future absent of the past and present
  problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Naturalisation</em>: Managers claim that the organization's assumptions, its
  view of the word, and goals are self-evident, or natural.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Opportunism</em>: Managers buy into questionable trends or actions because good
  things will follow.  Instead of searching or explaining the purpose of an
  action they rationalize the doubts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The closing chapter proposes to fight functional stupidity with <em>critical
thinking</em>: querying assumptions, asking for and being prepared to give
justification and considering the outcomes and meaning of what we do.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that organizations instead of encouraging only optimism
they should build up <em>negative capability</em>, the ability to face uncertainty,
paradoxes and ambiguities.  Some steps in this directions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Post- or pre-mortems</em>: Take a good look at a failed project and learn from
  it.  Or, before a project starts try to imagine all possible ways the project
  could fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Listening to newcomers and outsiders</em>: New employees or an external person
  may point out deficiencies or silly things in your organization that you've
  grown accustomed to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Reflective routines and anti-stupidity task force</em>: Regularly stop to think
  and ask: <em>Why?</em>.  Evaluate your projects, structures and processes. Do they
  make sense? What's their purpose? Perhaps even try to discontinue or cancel
  an activity or an arrangement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I'd recommend <em>The Stupidity Paradox</em> to everybody who works for any
organization that employs more than a dozen people.  Functional stupidity --
characterized by the lack of reflexivity,  lack of justification and the lack
of substantive reasoning -- is everywhere in today's organizations.  This
sounds depressing.  Indeed, even the authors are concerned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Everyone from CEOs to low-level employees is regularly put at risk of
overdosing on stupidity management.  We believe  that this corporate no-think
is one of the most urgent, yet most challenging, issues that organizations
face today.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the book also makes the point that inhibiting individual thinking in
certain cases results in less conflicts, happier work environment and higher
productivity.</p>
<p><em>The Stupidity Paradox</em> helps to spot elements of functional stupidity and
provides some advise how to keep it under control.  In summary, the antidote of
functional stupidity is critical thinking: reflecting on your assumptions, on
your actions and on their consequences.</p>
