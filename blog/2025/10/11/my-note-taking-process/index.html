    <div class="content" style="hyphens:auto">
      <p>I began taking notes around age ten in primary school.  Though my teachers
certainly instructed us to do so, I don't remember if anyone actually taught me
<em>how</em> to take notes.  Like the rest of the class, I studied and revised using
them.  I followed the teacher's explanations with a pen in my hand, jotting
down words, sentences, and diagrams in my notebook.  I maintained this habit
during my entire studies.  Still today, I prefer to follow a lecture while
taking notes.</p>
<p>I view this in-class note-taking as a one-step process: I capture the teacher's
words on paper and the notes become directly usable for revising.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure1" src="https://thewagner.net/images/note-taking-process-one-step.svg" title="In-class note-taking produces notes that I can directly use for            revising."></p>
<p>When <a href="https://thewagner.net/blog/2021/06/05/practicing-writing/">I write at work</a>, I produce a lot of notes. For example,
during a meeting I capture the salient points of a discussion, but the
resulting notes, in their raw form, only make sense to me and to none of my
co-workers.  A meeting possesses much less structure than a university lecture,
the messy, somewhat unreadable in-meeting notes require an extra pass to render
them usable.</p>
<p>When I read a technical text, I take notes.  I don't underline or highlight
words in books; instead, I jot down the interesting word or concept together
with the page number.  Later, I go back to each notes' page and form a complete
sentence about the concept or idea.</p>
<p>A few years ago, reading <a href="https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes">How to Take Smart Notes</a> by SÃ¶nke Ahrens
made me think about my own note-taking process which now involves three kinds
of notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fleeting note</em>: temporary reminder of an idea, thought, or piece of
  information.</li>
<li><em>Project note</em>: information relevant to achieve a specific goal, often
  involving other people.</li>
<li><em>Permanent note</em>: distilled ideas and arguments that form the core of a
  knowledge base.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process still starts with the capture step, but it contains two more steps
which produce the project and permanent notes:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure2" src="https://thewagner.net/images/note-taking-process-multi2.svg" title="Data flow in my two-step note-taking process"></p>
<p>Let's see each step in detail.</p>
<h1>Capture</h1>
<p>During the <em>capture</em> step I write down any relevant information I want to hold
on for later.  I already mentioned writing meeting or literature notes; I jot
down anything that switches on that light bulb above my head. The capture
transforms an intangible idea into a fleeting note.</p>
<p>Since my school days, my capture method remained essentially the same.
Depending on my mood I draft words, create lists, or sketch shapes and arrows.
I don't follow any particular system; I characterize my technique as a mix of
linear and visual note-taking.</p>
<p>I haven't seen two people take notes the same way so I suspect any method that
produces legible written text yields usable fleeting notes.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking">Wikipedia</a> and many note-taking application vendors frame
note-taking as this capture step.</p>
<p>Capturing fleeting notes became almost automatic to me, but this step alone
doesn't produce useful notes.  I now believe the notes' value only emerges when
I do a second pass over my fleeting notes.</p>
<h1>Who, What, When, Where, Why</h1>
<p>The activity, which I name after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">Five Ws of journalism</a>,
starts if a fleeting note belongs to a project.  As David Allen explains in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a> you cannot <em>do</em> a project, you can only do
actions that bring you closer to the project's goals.  When processing a
project-relevant fleeting note, I identify actions and define the project's
next action.</p>
<p>In my personal system, I maintain a list of actions per project; the next
action appears as the first element.  At work, I store the project notes in
whatever system the team chooses.  The implementation doesn't matter as long as
the note reaches the people involved.</p>
<h1>Rephrase</h1>
<p>If a note doesn't relate to a specific project, I write a <em>permanent note</em> and
store it in my reference system.  These notes come in different kinds including
data sheets, manuals, literature review, definitions, and outlines.</p>
<p>For example, I keep a list of tools I require for replacing my bike's break
pads and a note detailing <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> commands I use
infrequently. I have notes about concepts and ideas from articles and
conference talks, and I draft summaries of books I read.</p>
<p>Initially, I tried to segregate the different note kinds, but now I simply
place every non-project related note in a single system.</p>
<p>Most fleeting notes demand work to reach the reference system.  I rephrase the
recorded concept using my own words.  I write full sentences in one or two
paragraphs, preferably in active voice, and I avoid lists and bullet points.
For example, my permanent note about Paul Graham's essay  <em>Writes and Write
Nots</em> reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his essay <a href="https://paulgraham.com/writes.html">Writes and Write Nots</a> Paul
Graham, predicts that in couple of decades most people will loose their
ability to write.  Clear writing requires clear thinking which makes writing
fundamentally hard.  When you have a more prestigious job, you require to
write more.</p>
<p>Today generative AI tools may write for you, but they don't to the thinking
part.  Paul Graham's prediction that the world will split into those who
write and those who "write not".  Following his previous argument, this
means we will have a split between "thinks" and "think nots".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took me only a few minutes to write these two paragraphs.  I can immediately
recall why this article resonated with me and explain it using my own words to
other people if I want to.</p>
<p>I admit, not all my notes look like this; sometimes I cannot find better words
than the original.  Sometimes I just copy over my fleeting notes and move on,
but when I skip the rephrase step I know I don't get the most out my notes.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In the past few years I adopted a two-step note-taking process.  I capture
ideas as fleeting notes.  For projects, I extract next actions from the
fleeting note and record a permanent note in a system the project team can
access.  Otherwise, I rephrase the fleeting note using my own words to create a
permanent note, which I store in a reference system.</p>
